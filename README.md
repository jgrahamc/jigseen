# jigseen

Small program that uses the [SIFT algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform) to figure out where a jigsaw piece needs to be placed.

# Usage

1. The program loads a file called jigsaw.png which should be the picture from which the jigsaw was cut.

2. The computer's webcam will come on and a jigsaw piece should be held up to the camera. Press any key.

3. An image is displayed showing the jigsaw piece and the artifacts found by the SIFT algorithm in the jigsaw.
